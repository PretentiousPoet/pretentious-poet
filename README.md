# spring-react

Minimal starter Template for a React + Spring Boot project using WebPack and react-hot-loader.

### Usage
To build the project, run
```
mvn clean install
```
The maven frontend plugin is used to build the frontend components as well.

To run the hot-reload dev server, first start the Spring Application by running 'BootReactApplication.java', and then execute
```
npm run dev
```
in the 'src/main/webapp' directory.
